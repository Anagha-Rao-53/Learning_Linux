Version control (Git) Notes

if your file structure looks like:
(root)
	-foo
		-bar.txt with hello world in it
then root and foo are called trees, the directories are called trees, and the files are called blobs

History - Linear sequence of snapshots. 
Git uses a directed acyclic graph to get the snapshots, instead of a linear sequence

so the newest state your project is in points back to the state your project was previously in

so if there are two seperate changes from one history, you can "merge" both changes

so there's potential for errors when you merge two of changes togethere, and if git notices something like this, git reports an error - "merge conflict"

type blob  = array <byte>
type tree = map <string, tree | blob >
type Commit = struct {
	parents array<commits>
	}
	author, message - strings
	snapshots - tree

All the references - the history is immutable - you cant change anything about it
